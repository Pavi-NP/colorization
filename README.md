# Colorization using Deep Learning Models

This Python script performs colorization on black and white images using two pre-trained deep learning models: ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17.

## Overview

Colorization is a process of adding color to monochrome images. This script utilizes deep learning models trained on large datasets to automatically 
colorize black and white images.

## Features

- Colorize black and white images using two pre-trained deep learning models: ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17.
- Save the colorized images as JPG files.
- Display the original black and white image, input image, and colorized images side by side.

## Results

The script generates colorized versions of the input black and white image using the ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17 models. 
It saves the colorized images as JPG files and displays them using matplotlib.

This project is inspired by the work of Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. The ECCV16 model is based on the research paper 
"Colorful Image Colorization" by Zhang et al., and the SIGGRAPH17 model is based on the research paper "Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with 
Learned Deep Priors" by Zhang et al.
